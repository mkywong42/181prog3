#2 Student ID : 
#2 Student Name : 
#3 Student ID :
#3 Student Name :

2. Meta-data page in an index file



3. Index Entry Format
    Our index entry is a struct that consists of the fields
        -RID
        -Key which is a union of an int value, float value and a char* value.  This is to allow this struct to be able to have 
        keys of different types.
        -pointer to left child which is stored as a page number
        -pointer to right child which is stored as a page number
    The entry's pointer to children are -1 if the index entry is a leaf.

4. Page Format
- Show your internal-page (non-leaf node) design.
- Show your leaf-page (leaf node) design.
    Our page format for non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes are the same.  


5. Implementation Detail
- Have you implemented non-lazy deletion? Choose Yes or No: Also provide implementation details if yes.
    We have chosen to implement lazy deletion.  Our pages do not merge and stay in the tree if all their entries are deleted.
